# API-project-AA-2021-2022
This repository contains my solution to the 2021-2022 end of course project of API (Algoritmi e Principi dell'Informatica). The request was to write a program for a game really similar to "wordly". My solution was to use a hashmap to store the words for the dictionary of possible solution words, while using a double linked list to see the filtered ones. The dictionary is filtered using information about the letters in the solution word, learnt after the players tries. This project was awarded 30/30.
